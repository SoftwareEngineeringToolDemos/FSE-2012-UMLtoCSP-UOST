  GETTING STARTED WITH THE UMLtoCSP Tool

  This document is still in a very early stage and covers only the most basic
  information needed to get the tool running. If you encounter problems,
  please don't hesitate to report them (See "Contact" at the end of this 
  document).

  Prerequisites
  -------------

  To get the toolkit running, you need:
  1. Java SDK, version 1.5 (prior versions won't work).
  2. Make sure that your system's environment variable $JAVA_HOME is set 
     properly and "tools.jar" is located at $JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar
  3. Make sure that you use the libraries provided with the tool (or newer versions). 
    
  Note that this tool uses the Dresden OCL Toolkit to parse the UML model and 
  the OCL constraints. All dresden libs needed to run the tool are also included 
  in this zip file. However, to obtain the latest version you can download and 
  compile the Dresden OCL Toolkit (http://dresden-ocl.sourceforge.net) and copy 
  the libs into the "libs/external" directory.
  
  If you want to create and load your own models, I recommend using the XMI export 
  in ArgoUML or Gentleware's "Poseidon for UML 3.0" (there is a free community edition). If you
  use Poseidon for UML 4.0 you must first process the exported XMI file with the XSLT provided at 
  http://fheidenreich.de/xmitool/ 

  Make sure your model's XMI file does not containe diagram data (untag the 
  corresponding option when saving XMI file).


  Conventions
  -----------

  In this document, the variable $BASE refers to the directory where you
  unpacked the zip file into. E. g. if you unpacked the toolkit
  into /home/UMLtoCSP, then $BASE would have the value "/home/UMLtoCSP".


  Running the tool on Windows
  ---------------------------

   There is a script in $BASE/UMLtoCSP.bat

   To run the tool, change working directory to $BASE and type:

        UMLtoCSP.bat


  Running the tool on Unix
  ------------------------

   There is a script in $BASE/UMLtoCSP.sh

   To run the tool, change working directory to $BASE and type:

        ./UMLtoCSP.sh
